# uPD72020x_firmware
 Firmware for the uPD720201 and uPD720202 

 This repo will be for LINUX SUPPORT ONLY!

 NO WINSLOBBER HERE! We don't do windowslobber! Ever.

 The goal is to create DEB's for vairous Debian based Linux distros including Debian, *buntu's, Mint, etc...

 RPM and anything from RH (blech! even worse then msloth winslobber!) will NOT BE SUPPORTED! Get a real packging system!

 Nor will snaps (good grief no!), or flatpaks (more RH garbage)

 NOTE: If you are some sort of license police who will get their panties all knotted up over having some non open source binary firmware in you system. Then get lost! 

What about licenses?? Well this is simple. We are NOT modifying the Renesas firmware in any way. Nor are we going to try either. We are simply packaging it in forms for easy use. We feel this is compliant with the Renesas license, if you own the card, then you can use the firmware files. 

THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! Nor did I stay at a Holidy Inn Express last night. 

In summary in re licenses:  Frankly, Margaret we don't care!
